# JobSearch
A simple job searching app using react native and Typescript.  
Using the jSearch api from rapid api.  
This projects UI design and implementation is from Javascript Mastery youtube channel.  
I only implemented the logic.  

Libraries, frameworks and other stuff used in this project  
expo  
react query  
axios  
firebase (not yet)  
jest (not yet)  

I know there is an API key commited, its a free api key (i am broke) so it dont matter and i don't know how to use environment variables.
